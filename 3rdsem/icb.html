                  Identify a radical innovation that might affect an industry in an unprecedented manner. Explain how this innovation could affect competition once it enters the market place.It could either be a process, product or service innovation.<br>
                  <br>
                  Solution:<hr><p class="lead">JIO<br>I believe JIO is radical innovation, when it was launched in 2015, it overtook all the competitors within the period of 2-3 years. The company totally changed the telecom industry of India, its strategies and aggressiveness in implementing the ideas and strategies made the company the fastest growing telecommunication company in India. The company started offering 4G data and free voice calling facility for free as a marketing for more than 6 months. Later,  it introduced numerous plans for consumers like free voice calling and unlimited internet data. 
                  The company was first to do so, before that telecom company used to charge roughly around Rs. 350-400 for 1GB data but Jio offered whole month plan for same amount i.e. 1.5GB data and free unlimited calls. Later, the company gained more than half of the telecom consumers. After that Jio offered fiber based home broadband, that also became the hit product of Jio and it gained more consumers than Airtel Broadband.

                <p class="lead">Solution:<br>
                  IS  INNOVATION IN INDIA INC. UNDERGOING A RADICAL SHIFT?<br>1. In order to determine success many factors are required like whether there is demand for the innovation or not, or whether the market is a lead-market or not.<br>2. Rajan Wadhera, head of Mahindra Research Valley, is creating  inhouse product development capabilities. He is very certain that with borrowed  technology, indian companies can only hope to increase market share ans that “where as for the long run we need to build our own technologies for better performance and profitability.<br>3. As an example, the  godrej company built Chotukool, a compact portable fridge, mainly focusing on rural populations, which is now used by urban population also. <br>4. But, sometimes innovation can react in opposite directions also, like Innovation of Nano, as it was expected to storm the market but failed to do so, as people didn’t want to own something which was cheap and didn’t hold much value in the eyes of the public.<br> 5. Currently, India is the fastest growing base of startups worldwide; around 3 out of 4 startups are born each day and attracted a handsome amount  of around $5billion for 2015.<br>6. Now companies are throwing more into R&D and focusing on solving immediate problems of society.<br>7. Many companies are finding merit in distinct, dedicated innovation groups, removed from day-to-day routine  and hierarchies.<br>8. Tata innovista received 1580 promising innovation projects in 2015 compared to a 101 in 2006. <br>9. Partnering with foreign institutions is easy compared to Indian institutions  in India, as they are more driven towards innovation than Indian Institutions, according to UnniKrishnan of TCS. <br> 10. Pre-eminence is the perseverance required to take breakthrough or disruptive ideas to markets. self-dout , at the individual and the company level invariably show up at the last mile and only a strong leadership witha deep desire to reshape the world.

                <br><p class="lead">                In the previous assignment each one of you identified three interesting innovations. Good going so far!
                Step 2 is to now map the innovation process for any one out of the 3 products that you had listed.<br>The structure of your report should be thus:<br>1. Name of the innovation.<br>2. How did this opportunity develop? Was it technology looking for a need or need forcing a technology development?<br>3. Additional Information on how the company took it forward.
                <br><br> SOLUTION:<br>Innovation: Uber<br>Uber was founded by Garrett Camp and Travis Kalanick, in March 2009. Once the founders were in Paris to attend a LeWeb, an annual tech conference in 2007, and after the conference the duo was unable to find a cab in the mid of winter night, and at last the duo had to spent  $800 hiring a private driver, that's when the idea came to them that sharing the cost with people could make  it affordable, but and the morphed into Uber. following that they launched a beta version of their app in march 2010 with only 3 cars, and finally the official launch in 2011. Initially, Uber only allowed users to book luxury cars. <br>As the company came to focus, the field of service increased, initially starting from 3 cars they expanded to more than hundreds cars in a year. With the time, the company expanded globally and launched many services ranging their cab services from motorcycles to luxury cars like BMW and Mercedes and options like ride sharing and  booking a cab which goes according to your wallet. 
                Now, the company's R&D is working towards self-driving cars and air-taxis, in America the company has launched the beta version of their services for testing purposes and maybe they will launch these services to the general public soon.
